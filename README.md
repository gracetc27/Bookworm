# Bookworm 
Project 11 in my 100 days of SwiftUI- Hacking with Swift journey. This project looks at creating custom components and has a light introduction to SwiftData. 
It allows users to add books they have read to a list, letting them rate and review it. In the detail view of each book, it displays the title, author, genre, date it was added, a written review and a star rating.
# Features
